# self-organizing-maps
This is an implementation of self-organizing maps in python.

To run this, you will have to install the requirements by doing:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to have jupyter-notebook installed, which you can get by doing:
    pip install jupyter-notebook
    
You can then open the ipython notebook (som.ipynb) and see the output from the previous run, or run the code block by block.
